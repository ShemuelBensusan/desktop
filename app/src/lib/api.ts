 * |-----------|------|-----------|-----------------|
 * | 1         | 1    | 10        | 10              |

 * | 4         | 2    | 40        | 80              |
 * | 5         | 2    | 80        | 160             |
 * | 6         | 3    | 80        | 240             |
 * | 7         | 4    | 80        | 320             |

 * This algorithm means we can have the best of both worlds.
 * If there's a small number of changed pull requests since
 * our last update we'll do small requests that use minimal
 * bandwidth but if we encounter a repository where a lot
 * of PRs have changed since our last fetch (like a very
 * active repository or one we haven't fetched in a long time)
 * we'll spool up our page size in just a few requests and load
 * in bulk.
 *
 * As an example I used a very active internal repository and
 * asked for all PRs updated in the last 24 hours which was 320.
